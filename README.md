# ATmega324PB Peripheral Libraries

This repository contains libraries for peripherals of the ATmega324PB µC. Each one of these peripherals is accompanied by a PDF file that gives an overview of the different functionalities and important registers. These libraries should be easily portable to other AVR µCs once a basic understanding is gained of the different peripherals and the functionalities that can be enabled by their registers.

The making of these libraries took place in the context of developing the embedded systems and control circuitries of multiple student made rockets at ISS (IPSA Space Systems). The ATmega324PB µC was used in a rocket that was in development from September 2019 to July 2021 called IPER (ISS Parafoil Experimental Rocket). The 3 meter rocket performed a nominal flight during the "C'Space" event in mid 2021. The development resumed on September 2021 in order to optimize and improve on the different parts of the rocket.
