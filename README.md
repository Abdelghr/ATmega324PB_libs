# ATmega324PB Peripherals Libraries

This repository contains libraries for the peripherals of the ATmega324PB µC. These libraries should be easily portable to other AVR µCs once a basic understanding is gained of the different peripherals and the functionalities that can be enabled by their registers. All the libraries are application specific and are not meant to be englobing all the functionalities and modes of operation of the different peripherals.

The making of these libraries took place in the context of developing the embedded systems and control circuitries of multiple student made rockets at the student rocketry club ISS (IPSA Space Systems). The ATmega324PB µC was used in a rocket that was in development from September 2019 to July 2021 called IPER (ISS Parafoil Experimental Rocket), which is part of the CNES's PERSEUS project. The 3 meter rocket performed a nominal flight during the international launch campaign C'Space in July 2021. The development resumed on September 2021 in order to optimize and improve on the different aspects of the rocket.
