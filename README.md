# ATmega324PB Peripheral Libraries

This repository contains libraries for peripherals of the ATmega324PB µC. Each one of these peripherals is accompanied by a PDF file that gives an overview of the diffrent functionnalities and important registers. These libraries should be easily portable to other AVR µCs once a basic understanding is gained of the different peripherals and the functionnalities that can be enabled by their peripherals.

The making of these libraries took place in the contexte of developping the embedded systems and control circuiteries of multiple student made rockets at ISS (IPSA Space Systems). The ATmega324PB µC was used on a rocket that was in developpment from septembre 2019 to july 2021 called IPER (ISS Parafoil Experimental Rocket). The 3 meter rocket performed a nominal flight during the C'Space event in mid 2021.
